# Pokemon-Black-and-White-Intro-Speedup

This set of patches for Pokémon Black and White will speed up the intro up to the first N fight!

## What this speeds up
- There is much less text in the first set of rival fights, and less movement.
- Downstairs after the rival fights, much less talking will occur and your rivals will leave quickly.
- Bianca in her house does not get yelled at by her dad and instead walks out quickly once you head in.
- In the lab, the conversation is massively reduced.
- Speaking with mom after the lab is much quicker.
- The initial walking on Route 1 is much less clunky.
- The entire wild catching tutorial is skipped and you are given pokeballs when it's supposed to occur.
- The dialogue at the end of Route 1 is quicker.
- The Pokécenter tutorial is much faster. You walk in, heal your pokemon. The professor then heads out and you're done.
- The Ghetsis cutscene is extremely short. He will say nothing and just walk away after a brief formation.
- The crowd talk after the Ghetsis cutscene is basically nonexistent.
