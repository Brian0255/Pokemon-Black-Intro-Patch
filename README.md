# Pokemon-Black-Intro-Patch

This patch for Pokémon Black will speed up the intro significantly.

## What this speeds up
- There is much less text everywhere.
- Downstairs after the rival fights, much less talking will occur and you will get more key items from mom.
- The Bianca house sequence is skipped.
- The lab sequence is skipped.
- The post-lab sequence is skipped.
- The initial walking on Route 1 is much less clunky.
- The entire wild catching tutorial is skipped. You nickname your Pokemon here, then are given Pokeballs and the Pokedex.
- The end of Route 1 sequence is skipped.
- The Pokécenter tutorial is skipped.
- The Ghetsis cutscene is extremely short. He will say nothing and just walk away after a brief formation.
- Mom calling you at the start of Route 2 is skipped.
- The C-Gear is optional to pick up.
